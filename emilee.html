    <h4>My leadership philosophy is rooted in my belief that every child has unique strengths and talents that should be celebrated and developed upon. As a future educator, I aim to recognize and harness these strengths, providing a nurturing environment that encourages collaboration and mutual respect. I believe that by leading with empathy and creating a supportive atmosphere, I can empower my students to overcome challenges and reach their full potential.<br>

    Mr.Webb, a figure of esteem in my academic journey, was not just a history teacher but a mentor whose leadership style was characterized by unwavering support and genuine pride in his students' acievemnets. His classroom was a sanctuary where every student, including me, felt empowered to explore their own learning styles and take the lead in presenting material in ways that resonated with their personal interests and strengths. His saying is "You're doing an amazing job, keep it up!" His encouragement was a constant force, pushing me and my peers to excel without pressure of rigid expectations.<br>

    My Leadership style has always been a unique blend of Democratic and Laissez-Faire approaches. I embrace the Democratic aspect by encouraging participation and valuing the input of each team member. However, I also lean towards Laissez-Faire by providing autonomy and trusting my team to make decisions, often basing my own decisions on their wisdom rather than imposing my own views. A saying that my parents always taught me was " Leadership is not about being in charge. Its about taking care of those in your charge." One of my greatest strengths is my empathetic nature, which allows me to connect with my team on a personal level. I understand that each individual brings a unique perspective and set of skills to the table, and I leverage this diversity to enhance out teams performance and innovation. Despite these strengths, there are challenges I face. My tendency to rely too heavily on the insights of others can sometimes lead to indecisiveness. I am working on developing a more balanced approach that incorporates both the wisdom of my team and my own experience and intution.<br>

    Growing up, I found solance and expression in dance, dedicating 14 years of my life to the art form. This experience instilled in me a deep sense of disipline, teamwork, and the courage to perform under pressure. However, when the pandemic struck in 2020, it abruptly ended my dancing journey, prompting me to seek new avenues for growth and leadership.<br>

    Amidst the uncertainry, I took on a role at Mcdoanlds, quickly advancing to become a crew trainer. This environment presented a new set of challenges, as I had to adapt to the fast-paced, often chaotic work environment. It was here that I began to develop my leadership skills, learning to communicate effectively, delegate tasks, abd motivate my team to deliver exceptional service. In addition to my job at Mcdoanlds, I also took on various leadership roles in school, organizing events and even joining and outdoor educational leadership course. These experiences taught me the value of initiative, and collaboration, as well as the importance of resilience in the face of adversity, such as the isolation I felt due to bullying I endured.<br>

    When I moved to midland and started at Georgian Bay Secondary School, I embraced the chance to explore new interests. Although I found that some clubs werent a good fit, my determination led me to an interdisciplinary course that aligned with my passion for leadership. This transistion, while challenging, further shaped my adaptability and problem solving skills. My leadership journey took another significant step forward when I became the manager at Midland Mcdonalds. This role allowed me tyo put my skills into practice on a larger scale, guiding my team to achieve our goals and even spearheading initiatives like McHappy Day. My experience has taught me that true leadership is about fostering a positive work environment and empowering others to succeed.<br>

    Throughout my journey, I have faced numerous challenges, from the emotional toll of bullying to the pressure of leading a team at a young age. These experiences have been pivotal in shaping my leadership style, which emphasizes empathy, resilience, and the value of collaboration. I have learned that it is in the moments of struggle that we discover our true strengths and the potiental to make a positive impact.<br>
