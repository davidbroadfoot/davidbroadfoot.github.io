<h2 style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> Future goals and plans - things I wish to achieve. </h2>
<p>  September I will be going into a undergraduate program at Lakehead University Orillia majoring in psychology and minoring in criminology. I hope to graduate university and hopefully go into graduate school for forensic psychology in Toronto. I hope I will become a forensic psychologist (if I can afford all that schooling in this economy, good god) Or at most, I hope to be in a career that will make me enough money to live comfortably!! I also plan to study abroad in my program or just travel in general! I've always wanted to travel to Iceland at some point, so I plan to go there sometime in the next few years!!

</p><h2 style="Brush Script MT, Brush Script Std, cursive"> My personal leadership philosophy</h2>
My leadership philosophy prioritizes connection and communication. I think that without forming a proper, empathetic connection with people, one cannot lead. Knowing and understanding people would help a leader to prioritize the proper things.  
<h2> Inspirational leader to me </h2>
<p>An inspirational leader to me would have to be my Aunt Connie, she has always perservered and has supported me in everything I do. She constantly tells me to value myself and my leadership skills no matter what. Over the years she has guided me in both my education, and my career. She has helped me craft cover letters, resumes and emails to ensure I fufill my true potential even if most of the time I don't have the energy or confidence to do so &lt;3 </p>

<h2>My Leadership style + Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
<p> I take more of a a ffiliative leadership style. I prefer to form connections and foster a positive, friendly environment. This also means I tend not to lead at all, I very rarely take a leadership role and am more of a support beam of a worker more than anything. I am more than happy to let someone else take the lead, as long as they're being kind while doing so! Some of my leadership strengths are that I am empathetic and understanding of ones circumstances and perspectives, people often tell me I am quiet and kind. Although to speak on negatives, sometimes I can be too kind, to my own detriment. I often let people walk all over me. </p>
<h2>History of personal leadership development</h2>
<p>4-H: I participated in 4-H for a few years of my childhood. 4-H Ontario is a non-profit youth development organization that offers hands-on learning experiences. focuses on personal growth, community involvement, and skill development. In my case, I learned how to show sheep and from that I learned not only how to care for something, but how to become a leader for myself. I had a lot of fun, and I even won some awards.

</p> Leadership Class: From this class I learned that not all assignments have to suck. I am coding right now = case in point<p></p>

<p>Ladies Auxillary: From my childhood to now, I have participated in many events lead by the Ladies Auxillary in my hometown. Most often, I have been in the Santa Claus parade as an elf, which is only mildly humiliating. Last year I was a dog, so that was worse</p>
