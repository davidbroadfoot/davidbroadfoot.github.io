            <div style="padding-right: 350px;">
        Leadership is a dynamic journey, one that requires the ability to alternate between being a follower and a leader. To lead effectively, it is essential to first experience the role of a follower, as this provides a foundational understanding of teamwork, empathy, and the diverse perspectives fostered by different people and communities. By following, one learns the intricacies of group dynamics, the importance of listening, and the value of supporting others, all of which are critical skills for any effective leader.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        My leadership philosophy is deeply rooted in the principle of inclusive and respectful collaboration. I am dedicated to hearing all sides of an issue and valuing every team member&#39;s input. This approach promotes serenity and ensures that decisions are well-rounded and considerate of all perspectives. Open dialogue and mutual respect are not just cornerstones but the very foundation of my leadership style, as constructive communication, is key to resolving conflicts and achieving common goals. In the face of challenges, I focus on what is possible, even when situations appear impossible. This involves maintaining a positive outlook and a solution-oriented mindset, which are crucial for overcoming obstacles and driving progress. By concentrating on opportunities and potential solutions, leaders can inspire their teams to persevere and innovate, turning adversity into success.
        <br/>
        <br/>
     Moreover, effective leadership requires adaptability and a willingness to learn continuously. The ability to evolve and grow in response to new experiences and feedback is vital for staying relevant and effective. As a leader, I strive to embody these qualities, encouraging continuous improvement and fostering an environment where everyone feels empowered to contribute their best. In essence, my approach to leadership is multifaceted, encompassing learning, empathy, collaboration, resilience, and adaptability. By integrating these elements, I aim to inspire and guide others toward achieving shared goals and creating a positive impact. Through this journey, I seek to lead and cultivate an environment where leadership is a shared and collective endeavour.

My Leadership Style - Positives &amp; Negatives
</div></h2> 
Integrity • Self-Awareness • Empathy • Communication • Active Listening • Respect • Adaptability • Gratitude
<br/>
<br/>
My leadership style is characterized by a strong dedication to nurturing positive relationships and creating a collaborative and supportive work environment. I believe in leading authentically, being aware of my own strengths and weaknesses, and inspiring others to do the same. Respect and empathy are at the core of my leadership approach, ensuring that every team member feels valued and empowered. I have a clear vision for the team&#39;s goals, which serves as a guiding force, motivating others to strive for excellence and work together towards a common purpose. Effective communication, adaptability, and a commitment to collaboration allow me to harness the diverse strengths of my team, fostering innovation and driving results. My influence is built on credibility, vision, unwavering integrity, courage, and gratitude. By leading with integrity, taking calculated risks, and expressing genuine appreciation for my team, I cultivate a culture of trust, resilience, and collective achievement. Through leadership, I demonstrate the transformative impact of building strong relationships and nurturing a supportive environment where every individual can thrive and succeed.
<br/>
<br/>
My personal growth and self-improvement journey stands as a testament to resilience and determination. Overcoming challenges, such as the fear of speaking up and sharing ideas, as well as a lack of confidence, has been a significant part of my journey. The transition to online learning due to COVID-19 presented unique challenges, but I persevered, showing adaptability and resilience in the face of adversity. Building relationships and fostering collaboration was once a limitation, but I&#39;ve developed confidence in my abilities to work effectively within a team through dedication and effort. While I&#39;ve made significant progress, I understand that growth is an ongoing process, and I acknowledge that occasional mistakes and biases are part of the learning journey. Ultimately, each obstacle I&#39;ve overcome has contributed to my development as a leader, equipping me with the wisdom and empathy to inspire others on their paths of growth and transformation.

    My Leadership Development
    </h2> 
</div> 
 Reflecting on my journey, I recall how my early years were marked by a natural inclination towards leadership, intelligence, and a genuine enjoyment of collaborating with peers. However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the trajectory I had envisioned for myself. Starting high school in a different environment from my familiar peers initially felt like a significant disadvantage. Yet, as I navigated through the challenges of adapting to both in-person and online learning, I realized that these experiences were shaping me in unexpected ways.
 <br/>
 <br/>
Rather than viewing the disruptions as setbacks, I began to see them as opportunities for personal and leadership growth. Each transition forced me to confront new realities and adapt my approach accordingly. Over time, I found that my leadership skills were resilient and more refined than before. The blend of in-person and online learning environments offered unique insights into collaboration, adaptability, and resilience—qualities that have become indispensable in my leadership journey.
<br/>
<br/>
In hindsight, I see that every obstacle I faced became a stepping stone towards becoming a more versatile and effective leader. Embracing the challenges with determination and a growth mindset allowed me to emerge from adversity stronger and more confident in my abilities. As I continue to evolve and learn, I am grateful for the lessons learned along the way and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. My perspective has shifted from seeing challenges as barriers to recognizing them as catalysts for growth, shaping me into the leader I am today.

<h3>
Presentation For School Board - Grade 3
</h3>
I had my first taste of leadership in elementary school in grade 3. Our teachers selected a few students to represent our grade and communicated a presentation with the school board to ensure we received a quality education. I specifically focused on mathematics and worked with my classmates to create a visually apealing presentation using slides. Presenting to the school board was a fantastic opportunity, especially at such a young age, and it taught me valuable skills that I still use today.

<h3>
Flag football - Grades 7 &amp; 8
</h3>
In grade 7, I attended a small school with only one class per grade. A few boys in the intermediate grades wanted to start a football team, but they needed a few girls to meet the co-ed requirements. With only a handful of girls available, they were still short one player. As a new student, I knew one of the girls on the team and decided to give it a shot. Although our team didn&#39;t achieve much that year, I discovered my love for flag football. In grade 8, I joined the flag football team at my new, slightly larger school. We dedicated a lot of time to practice, and our hard work paid off when we emerged victorious in the flag football tournament. This experience ultimately shaped me into the competitive and collaborative leader I am today.

Cross Country - Grade 8
</h3>
In 8th grade, a lot of my friends were really involved in sports and were members of various sports teams. When I got the chance to help out with the cross-country event setup, I immediately jumped at the opportunity. It was a great experience because I got to collaborate with my friends and also reconnect with classmates from my previous schools. Throughout the event, I had the chance to meet new people and exhibit leadership skills by being punctual and offering assistance, and overall, it was an enriching experience.

Started Working - Grade 9
</h3>
Ever since I turned 14 years, I have been enthusiastic about showcasing my leadership abilities and earning my own income. My journey into the workforce began at Pizza Nova, where I was introduced to the world of employment in a laid-back and welcoming environment. This experience significantly contributed to my personal growth and instilled a sense of responsibility in me. Following my time at Pizza Nova, I transitioned to working at Winners for a period exceeding one year before taking a brief hiatus. During this break, I had the opportunity to work at my aunt&#39;s business, gaining valuable insights and skills. It&#39;s remarkable how life has come full circle as I have now returned to Pizza Nova, this time as a delivery driver.

Joined Student Council - Grade 10
</h3>
In grade 10, I decided to become more engaged in my Georgian Bay community, so I joined the Student Council. I was an active member of the group for a few months, contributing to a few initiatives and projects. However, I encountered personal challenges at home, which significantly impacted my ability to manage the responsibilities of being on the council. Ultimately, the stress became overwhelming, and I had to make the difficult decision to leave the position.

Hygeine Drive for Simcoe Youth Wellness Hub - Grade 11
</h3>
During my junior year, as part of my challenge and change in society course, we were given the task of creating a final project aimed at making a positive impact on society. After thoughtful consideration, I decided to focus on providing support to my peers who were encountering challenges. Upon learning about our local youth hub from the school social worker, I took the initiative to reach out to the youth hub and received permission to organize a donation drive. Over the span of a few weeks, I diligently collected items and, in the end, I was able to donate several hundred dollars&#39; worth of hygiene products to assist those in need.

<h3>
Art Exhibitions - Grades 10-12
</h3>
During my time in high school, I discovered a deep passion for both realism and abstract art. In order to further develop my skills, I decided to create several paintings to exhibit and potentially sell at our local art exhibition. In the end, I ended up creating three stunning realism pieces, all of which were displayed, and three unique abstract art paintings that garnered a lot of attention. On the night of the exhibition, I dressed up and was recognized as &quot;Kenzie,&quot; the talented artist behind the impressive artworks. I received numerous praises and compliments for my creations, which was truly heartwarming. Although the piece I put up for sale didn&#39;t sell at the price I had hoped for, I was approached by several individuals expressing interest in purchasing one of my other pieces. Despite the offers, I ultimately decided not to sell any of my artworks and chose to keep them all for myself.

This year, in our leadership class, we organized a prom bake sale to raise funds for the upcoming prom. We divided ourselves into groups and put our baking skills to work, creating a wide variety of delicious treats to sell during lunchtime. I was responsible for managing the money box and handling transactions with a few other classmates. Throughout the bake sale, I also took on the role of overseeing the entire event, ensuring everything ran smoothly. From setting up the bake sale to coordinating the clean-up afterward, I was actively involved in making the event a success.

Wellness Fair - Grade 12

This year in our leadership class, we were responsible for organizing and running a wellness fair. We divided ourselves into teams to manage different stations, games, and events. I led the face painting station and assisted with the arts and crafts area along with a few others. The wellness fair was an incredible success, with a large turnout of peers who stayed engaged throughout the event. As a special touch, our class created custom shirts for the occasion and encouraged everyone to sign them. This not only added a personal touch to the event but also sparked meaningful conversations, fostered collaboration, and made the fair an overall enjoyable and memorable experience for everyone involved.

<h3>
Drawing Jody Wilson Raybould - Grade 12
</h3>
This year, I had the wonderful opportunity to read &quot;Indian in the Cabinet&quot; by Jody Wilson-Raybould. This captivating book provided me with a deep understanding of Indigenous issues and left me with a profound admiration for Wilson-Raybould as the first Indigenous female member of parliament. Eager to honour her achievements, I decided to create a stunning portrait of her to adorn the walls of my law classroom. Bringing her resemblance to life through my artwork required a total of 34 hours of dedicated effort. I meticulously worked on capturing her essence, and I&#39;m incredibly proud of the progress I&#39;ve made in honing my artistic skills.

Regarding our neighbouring country, I have taken a road trip to Florida, marvelling at the diverse landscapes of the states along the way. Additionally, I had the opportunity to visit Atlantic City in New Jersey, experiencing the vibrant energy of the East Coast. As for international travel, I have ventured to Costa Rica and am currently planning to visit the Bahamas soon.

Her dogs are not only well-behaved but also have a special connection with her. This has motivated me to aspire to have a similar relationship with a large breed dog, which I can train for protection while also being a loving and cherished member of my family. This is particularly important to me because my experience with a very small dog has shown me the limitations in training and the need for a larger, more capable companion. Ultimately, I am looking for a loyal companion to nurture and share love with.

<div style="text-align:center;">
“I come from a long line of matriarchs, and that’s what gave me strength to do what I needed to do. The strength that we have as Indigenous Peoples, and particularly as Indigenous women, is that we show the way. We guide the path. We guide chiefs. That’s my role in the Big House. And that’s what’s carried me through this last tumultuous year.”

<br/>
Jody Wilson-Raybould&#39;s story is one of profound depth and resilience, rooted in a heritage of strong matriarchs and a rich indigenous history. Growing up within a family deeply connected to their ancestral traditions, she absorbed invaluable lessons from the wisdom of her foremothers, who supported and guided her throughout her life. Transitioning from the governance structures of her Indigenous community to the intricate workings of federal politics was a journey filled with challenges and opportunities. With each step, she carried with her the teachings of her ancestors, navigating the complexities of this transition with grace and determination. Wilson-Raybould&#39;s journey is one of personal growth and profound societal significance. Her transition symbolizes the intersection of Indigenous heritage with the modern world, showcasing the resilience of Indigenous peoples in adapting to change while preserving their cultural identity.
<br/>
