<body> I aim to become a skilled guitarist like Melissa Etheridge and achieve my dream of owning a peaceful farmhouse in the country, with my many dogs and wicked vinyl collection.

<div style="text-align:center"> <body> I live by Ru Paul’s leadership philosophy of “Sashaying away” from negativity and setbacks. And embracing challenges as opportunities to grow and evolve.

<div style="text-align:center"> <body> Britney Spears is an inspirational leader to me because of her resilience in overcoming personal and professional challenges, her support for mental health awareness, and her fight for autonomy. My favourite quote is from her song “I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman”, and it's “I'm not a girl, don't tell me what to believe.” This shows her cultural importance and how she empowers women while also being a symbol of strength.

<body>My leadership strengths include being incredibly bossy, which is also my weakness. Double edged sword lol. Another quality is my crippling self awareness yay? My last quality is my passion for depop and poshmark because i heart sustainable fashion, but my bank account doesn’t so thats also a weakness.

<body>Things that have helped me to develop my leadership skills include jobs, basketball, playing lead guitar (not to flex;), and just dealing with the public el oh el. I think a huge part of leadership is listening and learning from people who maybe have more wisdom or life experience. Thats part of my leadership philosophy.
